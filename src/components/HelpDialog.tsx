        <p>Since running the model locally is very taxing, lower-tier devices may not be able to run this PoC.
          For the best experience, try running AgentLLM on a powerful desktop device (with at least 6.5GB of GPU memory).</p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Getting started:

            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Launch Chrome Canary (preferably with --enable-dawn-features=disable_robustness).
          </li>
          <li>For example, in MacOS, run the following command in the terminal: /Applications/Google\ Chrome\ Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome\ Canary --enable-dawn-features=disable_robustness
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Navigate to AgentLLM
